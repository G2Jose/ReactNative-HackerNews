 @discussion JWT is a general interface for decoding and encoding.
 Now it is too complex and fat to support.
 Possible solution: split interface into several pieces.
 
 JWT_1_0 -> JWT with plain old functions.
 JWT_2_0 -> JWT with builder usage.
 JWT_3_0 -> JWT with splitted apart algorithm data and payload data.
